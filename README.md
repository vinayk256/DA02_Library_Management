## Objectives

1. **Understand Book and Category Usage Trends** Analyze which books, authors, and categories are most or least popular to guide inventory, acquisitions, and space planning.
2. **Track Member Behavior and Borrowing Patterns** Identify active readers, late returners, and high-value users to improve engagement, loyalty, and enforce policies when needed.
3. **Evaluate Staff and Branch Performance** Measure how employee roles and branch locations influence book circulation to optimize staffing and branch operations.
4. **Monitor Financial and Operational Efficiency** Calculate revenue from rentals, and evaluate overdue or unreturned books to ensure financial health and operational integrity.
5. **Gain Insights from Behavioral Correlations and Trends** Use data-driven insights (like issue-delay correlation, Pareto analysis) to predict patterns and support strategic decisions.
